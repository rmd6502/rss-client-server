# rss-client-server

Getting comfortable with RSS and Node and React. As of 3/28 adding mongoose / mongoDb.

Dependencies: Node, Express, npm rss-parser, npm-run-all (to run client and server at same time), npm cors, mongoose, mongodb 

Install mongoose, mongodb locally

Create a new MongoDB database named rss_feeds_db:

$ mongo
> use rss_feeds_db

Run the database with 

$ mongod

npm run dev / to start client and server if you so wish to run both from one command
